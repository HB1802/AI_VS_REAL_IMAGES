# Real vs AI Generated Image Classifier

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that aims to classify images as either real or AI-generated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview

The Real vs AI Generated Image Classifier project utilizes CNNs to accurately distinguish between real and AI-generated images. The model was built using TensorFlow's Keras API.
